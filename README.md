# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This application is a prework study guide made to contain information learnt for the pre work for my front end development course. This website was created to get used to using git, vs, css, gtml and javascript before the course starts and is a place to store any key notes fot future reference. It solves the problem of having no where to keep notes nice and tidy and means that notes can be easily accessible.
